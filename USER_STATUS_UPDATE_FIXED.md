# 🎯 User Status Update Issue - FIXED

## ✅ Problem Identified & Resolved

**Issue**: When clicking the "Suspend" button in User Management, the user status remained "active" instead of changing to "inactive".

**Root Cause**: The `handleToggleUserStatus` function was only showing a toast message but not actually updating the user data in the application state.

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### **Before (Broken)**
```typescript
const handleToggleUserStatus = async (email: string) => {
  // ... find user logic
  // Update user status logic here  ← This was just a comment!
  addToast(`User ${newStatus} successfully!`, 'success');
};
```

### **After (Fixed)**
```typescript
const handleToggleUserStatus = async (email: string) => {
  const user = users.find(u => u.email === email);
  if (user) {
    const newStatus = user.status === 'active' ? 'inactive' : 'active';
    
    // ✅ ACTUALLY UPDATE THE STATE
    (setUsers as any)((prevUsers: any[]) => 
      prevUsers.map((u: any) => 
        u.email === email 
          ? { ...u, status: newStatus }  ← Real state update!
          : u
      )
    );
    
    addToast(`User ${newStatus === 'active' ? 'activated' : 'deactivated'} successfully!`, 'success');
  }
};
```
