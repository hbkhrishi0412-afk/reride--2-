# 🔧 VIEW IMPORT ERROR FIXED

## ✅ **CRITICAL ERROR RESOLVED!**

I've fixed the `ReferenceError: View is not defined` error that was causing the AdminPanel to crash.

---

## 🚨 **Error Details**

**Error**: `ReferenceError: View is not defined`
**Location**: `AdminPanel.tsx:1900:47`
**Cause**: The `View` enum was imported as a type-only import, but was being used as a runtime value

---

## 🛠️ **Fix Applied**

### **Before (Broken):**
```typescript
import type { Vehicle, User, Conversation, PlatformSettings, AuditLogEntry, VehicleData, SupportTicket, FAQItem, SubscriptionPlan, PlanDetails, View } from '../types';
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```typescript
import type { Vehicle, User, Conversation, PlatformSettings, AuditLogEntry, VehicleData, SupportTicket, FAQItem, SubscriptionPlan, PlanDetails } from '../types';
import { View } from '../types';
```

---

## 🎯 **Why This Fix Works**

1. **Type vs Runtime Import**: The `View` enum was imported as a type-only import (`import type`), which means it's only available during TypeScript compilation, not at runtime.

2. **Runtime Usage**: The AdminPanel was using `View.HOME`, `View.USED_CARS`, etc. at runtime in the JSX, which requires the actual enum values.

3. **Proper Import**: By importing `View` as a regular import (`import { View }`), the enum is now available at runtime.
