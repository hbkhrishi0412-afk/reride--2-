# Profile Update Issues - Fixed

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. **Profile Updates Not Persisting**
**Problem**: When users updated their profile (name, mobile, avatar), the changes were saved to the `users` array but the `currentUser` state remained unchanged, so the UI didn't reflect the updates.

**Root Cause**: The `updateUser` function in `AppProvider.tsx` only updated the `users` array but didn't update the `currentUser` state or localStorage.

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
updateUser: (email: string, updates: Partial<User>) => {
  setUsers(prev => prev.map(user => 
    user.email === email ? { ...user, ...updates } : user
  ));
  
  // Also update currentUser if it's the same user
  if (currentUser && currentUser.email === email) {
    setCurrentUser(prev => prev ? { ...prev, ...updates } : null);
    
    // Update localStorage as well
    try {
      const updatedUser = { ...currentUser, ...updates };
      localStorage.setItem('reRideCurrentUser', JSON.stringify(updatedUser));
      sessionStorage.setItem('currentUser', JSON.stringify(updatedUser));
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to update user in localStorage:', error);
    }
  }
  
  addToast('User updated successfully', 'success');
},
```

### 2. **Password Update Without Validation**
**Problem**: Users could update their password without providing the correct current password.

**Root Cause**: The `onUpdatePassword` function in `App.tsx` didn't validate the current password before updating.

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
onUpdatePassword={async (passwords) => {
  if (currentUser) {
    // Validate current password
    if (currentUser.password !== passwords.current) {
      addToast('Current password is incorrect', 'error');
      return false;
    }
    
    // Update password
    updateUser(currentUser.email, { password: passwords.new });
    addToast('Password updated successfully', 'success');
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}}
```

### 3. **Missing Dependencies in useMemo**
**Problem**: The `useMemo` hook in `AppProvider.tsx` was missing some dependencies, which could cause stale closures and unexpected behavior.

**Fix Applied**: Added missing dependencies `setCurrentUser` and `setUsers` to the dependency array.

## Features Now Working

### ✅ Profile Picture Upload
- Users can now upload and update their profile pictures
- Images are converted to base64 and stored in the user's profile
- Changes persist across sessions via localStorage
- Real-time UI updates when profile picture is changed

### ✅ Profile Information Updates
- Users can update their name and mobile number
- Changes are immediately reflected in the UI
- Updates persist across browser sessions
- Success toast notifications confirm updates

### ✅ Password Updates
- Users must provide their current password to update
- New password must be at least 6 characters long
- Password confirmation validation
- Proper error handling for incorrect current password
- Success confirmation when password is updated

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- `currentUser` state is properly updated when profile changes
- `users` array is updated for admin/user management
- localStorage and sessionStorage are synchronized
- Real-time UI updates through React state management

### Validation
- Current password validation before password updates
- Password length validation (minimum 6 characters)
- Password confirmation matching
- Proper error messages and user feedback

### Persistence
- Profile changes are saved to localStorage
- Changes persist across browser sessions
- Session storage is also updated for consistency
- Error handling for storage failures

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Profile Picture Upload**:
   - Upload a new profile picture
   - Verify it displays immediately
   - Refresh the page and confirm it persists
   - Check that the image is properly converted to base64

2. **Profile Information**:
   - Update name and mobile number
   - Verify changes appear immediately
   - Refresh page and confirm persistence
   - Check localStorage for updated data

3. **Password Updates**:
   - Try updating with wrong current password (should fail)
   - Update with correct current password (should succeed)
   - Test with short passwords (should fail validation)
   - Verify password confirmation matching

## Files Modified

1. **`components/AppProvider.tsx`**:
   - Enhanced `updateUser` function to update `currentUser` state
   - Added localStorage synchronization
   - Fixed useMemo dependencies

2. **`App.tsx`**:
   - Added current password validation to `onUpdatePassword`
   - Enhanced error handling and user feedback

## Security Considerations

- Current password validation prevents unauthorized password changes
- Password updates require authentication
- Profile changes are tied to the authenticated user
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage

The profile update functionality is now fully working with proper validation, persistence, and user feedback!
