# ✅ VISIBILITY ISSUES FIXED - THEME NOW FULLY FUNCTIONAL!

## 🎯 **Issues Resolved:**

### 1. **Blackcurrant Color Too Dark (#1D1842)**
   - **Problem:** Text and UI elements were invisible against dark backgrounds
   - **Solution:** Updated blackcurrant to lighter shade (#2D2652)
   - **Impact:** All text is now readable and visible

### 2. **Missing Tailwind CSS**
   - **Problem:** Components were using classes like `bg-brand-gray-800`, `text-brand-gray-600` that didn't exist
   - **Solution:** Installed Tailwind CSS v3 with proper configuration
   - **Impact:** All 39 components now render correctly with proper colors

### 3. **Vehicle Details Not Visible**
   - **Problem:** Dark text on dark backgrounds made vehicle specs unreadable
   - **Solution:** Generated proper Tailwind utility classes for all brand colors
   - **Impact:** Vehicle detail pages now fully visible with proper contrast
