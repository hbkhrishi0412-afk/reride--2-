# 🔧 Website Not Loading - FIXED

## Critical Issues Resolved for Vercel Deployment

Your website was not loading after deployment due to multiple conflicts and misconfigurations. All issues have been fixed!

---

## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue #1: CDN Tailwind Conflict ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: The index.html was loading Tailwind CSS from CDN, conflicting with the built-in Tailwind from your build process.

**Impact**:
- Massive HTML file (8.64 kB)
- Style conflicts
- Slow loading
- Potential rendering issues

**Fix Applied**:
```html
<!-- REMOVED -->
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
<script>
  tailwind.config = { /* 80+ lines of config */ }
</script>
```

**Result**:
- ✅ index.html reduced from 8.64 kB to 2.28 kB (73% reduction!)
- ✅ No more Tailwind conflicts
- ✅ Faster loading
- ✅ Clean build output

---

### Issue #2: Mongoose ES Module Imports ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Vercel serverless functions failing with:
```
SyntaxError: The requested module 'mongoose' does not provide an export named 'models'
```

**Files Fixed**:
- ✅ `api/lib-user.ts`
- ✅ `api/lib-vehicle.ts`
- ✅ `models/User.ts`
- ✅ `models/Vehicle.ts`

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Before (Failing)
import { Schema, model, models } from 'mongoose';

// After (Working)
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
```

**Result**:
- ✅ All API endpoints working
- ✅ Database connection functional
- ✅ No more 500 errors

---

### Issue #3: Vercel Configuration ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Missing build configuration in vercel.json

**Fix Applied**:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": null
}
```

**Result**:
- ✅ Proper build process
- ✅ Correct output directory
- ✅ Framework detection disabled (we handle it ourselves)
