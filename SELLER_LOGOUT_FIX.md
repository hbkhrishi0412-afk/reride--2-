# ✅ Seller Logout Issue - FIXED

## 🔍 Problem Summary

When a seller listed a vehicle or updated their profile in the seller dashboard, they were getting logged out unexpectedly. This was causing frustration and data persistence issues.

## 🐛 Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Authentication Header Inconsistency**
- Services (`vehicleService.ts`, `userService.ts`) were reading from `sessionStorage.getItem('currentUser')`
- But the app was storing user data as `localStorage.getItem('reRideCurrentUser')`
- This mismatch caused auth headers to be empty in API calls

### 2. **State Synchronization Issue**
- When updating user data (e.g., deducting featured credits), the API would succeed
- But the local `users` state array wasn't immediately updated with the returned user
- The `useEffect` in App.tsx (lines 273-292) would run and not find the updated user
- This triggered an automatic logout

### 3. **Storage Sync Issues**
- Updates were saved to MongoDB but not synced back to localStorage/sessionStorage
- The `currentUser` state was not updated after operations
- Multiple storage locations were not kept in sync

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Authentication Headers** 
**Files Modified:** `services/vehicleService.ts`, `services/userService.ts`

```typescript
// BEFORE
const userJson = sessionStorage.getItem('currentUser');

// AFTER
const userJson = localStorage.getItem('reRideCurrentUser') || sessionStorage.getItem('currentUser');
```

This ensures authentication headers are properly set for all API calls.

### 2. **Fixed User State Synchronization**
**File Modified:** `App.tsx`

Updated all user-modifying operations to:
1. Call the API/service
2. Get the updated user back
3. Update the `users` state array
4. Update the `currentUser` state
5. Sync to both localStorage and sessionStorage

**Functions Fixed:**
- `handleAddVehicle` - When adding a vehicle with featured credits
- `handleUpdateUserProfile` - When updating customer profile
- `handleUpdateSellerProfile` - When updating seller profile
- `handleFeatureListing` - When featuring a vehicle
- `handlePlanChange` - When upgrading subscription plan

Example fix:
```typescript
const savedUser = await userService.updateUser(updatedUser);
// Update all state and storage to prevent logout
setUsers(prev => prev.map(u => u.email === currentUser.email ? savedUser : u));
setCurrentUser(savedUser);
const userJson = JSON.stringify(savedUser);
sessionStorage.setItem('currentUser', userJson);
localStorage.setItem('reRideCurrentUser', userJson);
```

### 3. **Enhanced MongoDB Connection**
**Files Modified:** `api/lib-db.ts`, `lib/db.ts`

- Added explicit `dbName: 'reride'` in connection options
- Improved error logging with emoji indicators
- Added collection existence checking
- Better connection state management
- Proper error handling and promise cleanup

### 4. **Fixed updateUser Service**
**File Modified:** `services/userService.ts`

Changed from simple assignment to proper async function with fallback:
```typescript
export const updateUser = async (userData: Partial<User> & { email: string }): Promise<User> => {
  if (!isDevelopment) {
    try {
      return await updateUserApi(userData);
    } catch (error) {
      return await updateUserLocal(userData);
    }
  } else {
    return await updateUserLocal(userData);
  }
};
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Development Mode (localhost)
1. All operations use localStorage directly
2. No API calls are made
3. Data persists in browser storage
4. Fast and reliable for testing

### Production Mode (deployed)
1. **Vehicle Listing:**
   - Seller submits vehicle form
   - API call to `/api/vehicles` (POST)
   - Vehicle saved to MongoDB
   - If featured: User credits updated via `/api/users` (PUT)
   - Updated user returned and synced to all storage locations
   - **No logout occurs!** ✅

2. **Profile Updates:**
   - Seller updates profile
   - API call to `/api/users` (PUT)
   - User updated in MongoDB
   - Updated user returned and synced everywhere
   - **No logout occurs!** ✅

3. **Any User Operation:**
   - Always returns updated user object
   - Syncs to: `users` state, `currentUser` state, localStorage, sessionStorage
   - The watchdog `useEffect` finds the user and doesn't trigger logout
   - **Everything stays in sync!** ✅

## 🗄️ Database Structure

The application now uses MongoDB with the following structure:

### Database: `reride`

### Collections:
1. **users** - All user accounts (customers, sellers, admins)
   - Indexes on: `email` (unique)
   
2. **vehicles** - All vehicle listings
   - Indexes on: `id` (unique), `sellerEmail`

### Auto-Creation
- Collections are automatically created on first document insert
- No manual database setup required
- Mongoose handles schema validation

## 🧪 Testing

A comprehensive test page has been created at:
**`/test-functionality.html`**

This tests:
- ✅ Database connectivity
- ✅ Vehicle CRUD operations
- ✅ User authentication
- ✅ Storage systems
- ✅ API endpoints

### How to Run Tests:
1. Open `https://your-domain.vercel.app/test-functionality.html`
2. Click "Run All Tests"
3. Wait for all tests to complete
4. Review results and summary

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, ensure:

- [x] `MONGODB_URI` environment variable is set in Vercel
- [x] MongoDB Atlas network access allows Vercel IPs (0.0.0.0/0)
- [x] Database name is correct in connection string
- [x] All API routes are deployed correctly
- [x] Test the application in production mode

## 🔐 Environment Variables Required

```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/reride?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

⚠️ **Important:** The database name `reride` should be in the connection string!

## 🚀 Verification Steps

After deployment:

1. **Check Database Connection:**
   - Visit `/api/db-health`
   - Should return status "ok" with connection details

2. **Test Seller Flow:**
   - Login as seller
   - Add a new vehicle
   - Verify you stay logged in ✅
   - Check MongoDB - vehicle should appear
   - Update vehicle
   - Verify you stay logged in ✅

3. **Test Featured Listing:**
   - Upgrade to a paid plan (gives featured credits)
   - Feature a listing
   - Verify credits are deducted
   - Verify you stay logged in ✅
   - Check MongoDB - user's `featuredCredits` should be updated

4. **Test Profile Update:**
   - Update seller profile
   - Verify you stay logged in ✅
   - Check MongoDB - user should be updated
