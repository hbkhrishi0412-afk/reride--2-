## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Icons Not Showing?
**Problem:** Default icon appears instead of custom icons

**Solution:**
1. Generate icons using `GENERATE_ICONS_HERE.html`
2. Save both files to `public/` folder
3. Rebuild: `npm run build`
4. Clear cache and test again

### Install Prompt Not Appearing?
**Problem:** No install prompt shows up

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 3 seconds after page load
2. Check if app already installed
3. Must be HTTPS (in production)
4. Check DevTools → Console for errors

### Service Worker Not Updating?
**Problem:** Changes don't appear after deploy

**Solutions:**
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Clear cache in DevTools → Application → Clear Storage
3. Unregister service worker and refresh
4. Wait (auto-updates happen on next visit)

### App Not Working Offline?
**Problem:** Offline mode shows error

**Solutions:**
1. Visit pages online first (to cache them)
2. Check service worker is active (DevTools → Application)
3. Review cached files (DevTools → Application → Cache Storage)
4. Rebuild app: `npm run build`
