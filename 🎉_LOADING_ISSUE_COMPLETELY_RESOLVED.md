## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **Loading Sequence:**
1. **App starts** → Shows content immediately (< 1 second)
2. **Background loading** → Services load asynchronously
3. **Progressive enhancement** → Features improve as data loads
4. **User can interact** → No waiting required

### **Service Loading Pattern:**
```typescript
// Services are loaded only when needed:
const { vehicleService } = await getServices();
const result = await vehicleService.addVehicle(vehicle);
```
