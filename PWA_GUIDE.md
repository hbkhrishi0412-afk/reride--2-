## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Install Prompt Not Showing
**Problem**: No install prompt appears
**Solutions**:
1. Check you're using HTTPS (required for PWA)
2. Clear browser cache and reload
3. Check DevTools → Application → Manifest
4. Ensure icons are accessible

### Service Worker Not Updating
**Problem**: Changes don't appear after deploy
**Solutions**:
1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear service workers in DevTools
3. Wait for auto-update (happens on next load)
4. Check "Update on reload" in DevTools

### Icons Not Loading
**Problem**: Default browser icon shows instead
**Solutions**:
1. Check `public/icon-192.png` and `public/icon-512.png` exist
2. Rebuild the app: `npm run build`
3. Clear cache and reinstall
4. Check image format (must be PNG)

### Offline Mode Not Working
**Problem**: App doesn't work offline
**Solutions**:
1. Visit pages online first (to cache them)
2. Check Service Worker is active in DevTools
3. Review cache storage in Application tab
4. Check network patterns in workbox config
