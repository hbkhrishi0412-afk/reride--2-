## 💰 Monetization Strategy

### **Tier 1: Featured Cars (₹999 Homepage Spotlight)**
```typescript
// Target vehicles for Featured Cars
const featuredCars = vehicles.filter(vehicle => 
  vehicle.isPremiumListing || 
  vehicle.activeBoosts?.some(boost => 
    boost.type === 'homepage_spotlight' && boost.isActive
  ) ||
  vehicle.certificationStatus === 'approved'
).slice(0, 8);
```

### **Tier 2: Popular Cars (₹499 Featured Badge)**
```typescript
// Target vehicles for Popular Cars
const popularCars = vehicles.filter(vehicle => 
  vehicle.isFeatured || 
  vehicle.activeBoosts?.some(boost => 
    boost.type === 'featured_badge' && boost.isActive
  ) ||
  (vehicle.viewsLast7Days > 50 && vehicle.inquiriesCount > 5)
).slice(8, 20);
```

## 🔧 Next Steps for Full Implementation

### 1. **Update Data Filtering Logic**
Replace the current `featuredVehicles` prop with separate data sources:

```typescript
interface HomeProps {
  featuredCars: Vehicle[];      // Premium spotlight vehicles
  popularCars: Vehicle[];       // Featured badge vehicles
  // ... other props
}
```

### 2. **Integrate Analytics Service**
Replace console.log with your analytics service:

```typescript
// Example with Google Analytics
const trackFeaturedCarsClick = (vehicleId: number, vehicleMake: string, vehicleModel: string) => {
  gtag('event', 'featured_cars_click', {
    vehicle_id: vehicleId,
    vehicle_make: vehicleMake,
    vehicle_model: vehicleModel,
    section: 'premium_spotlight'
  });
};
```

### 3. **Add Performance Metrics**
Track conversion rates, click-through rates, and revenue per section.

### 4. **A/B Testing**
Test different:
- Section names
- Visual designs
- Vehicle counts
- Badge styles
