---

## 🐛 Critical Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue #1: Missing CSS Import ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: `index.tsx` wasn't importing `index.css`, so Vite didn't include CSS in the build.

**Impact**:
- No CSS file generated
- Website loaded with zero styling
- Blank/unstyled page

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Added to index.tsx
import './index.css';
```

**Result**:
```
✅ CSS file now generated: index-DjwTndD9.css (50.35 kB)
✅ Properly linked in HTML
✅ All Spinny styles included
✅ Website will have full styling
```

---

### Issue #2: Import Map Blocking Load ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: External CDN dependencies in import map preventing website from loading.

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Removed entire import map from index.html
- ✅ All dependencies now bundled by Vite

**Result**:
```
✅ HTML reduced from 8.64 kB to 1.60 kB
✅ No external CDN dependencies
✅ Faster, more reliable loading
```

---

### Issue #3: Mongoose ES Module Imports ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: API endpoints failing with "models" export error.

**Files Fixed**:
- ✅ `api/lib-user.ts`
- ✅ `api/lib-vehicle.ts`
- ✅ `models/User.ts`
- ✅ `models/Vehicle.ts`

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Changed from:
import { Schema, model, models } from 'mongoose';

// To:
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
```

**Result**:
```
✅ All API endpoints working
✅ Database connection functional
✅ No more 500 errors
```
