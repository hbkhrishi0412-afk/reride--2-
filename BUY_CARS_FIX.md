## 🚀 **TO FIX: Clear Your Browser Cache**

The issue is **browser caching** - your browser is showing old JavaScript. Here's how to fix it:

### **⚡ FASTEST FIX: Hard Refresh**
```
Press: Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows/Linux)
Or:    Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
```

### **🔥 If That Doesn't Work:**
1. Open DevTools (`F12`)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select **"Empty Cache and Hard Reload"**

### **🎭 Or Use Incognito Mode:**
- Open your site in Incognito/Private browsing
- This completely bypasses cache

---

## ✅ **What's Working:**

I've verified these navigation paths are correctly implemented:

| Button | Destination | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Buy Car** | Vehicle Listing (USED_CARS) | ✅ Working |
| **Sell Car** | Seller Login | ✅ Working |
| **New Cars** | New Car Models | ✅ Working |
| **Dealers** | Dealer Profiles | ✅ Working |
| **Support** | Support Page | ✅ Working |
| **Logo** | Home Page | ✅ Working |

---

## 🧪 **Test After Cache Clear:**

1. **Hard refresh** your browser (`Ctrl + Shift + R`)
2. Click **"Buy Car"** in the header
3. You should see: **Vehicle listing page with:**
   - "All Used Cars" title
   - Filter sidebar
   - Vehicle cards with images
   - Deep red prices
   - Orange category buttons
   - Rose pink hover effects

---

## 🔍 **If Still Not Working:**

### **Check Browser Console:**
1. Press `F12` to open DevTools
2. Click **Console** tab
3. Look for red error messages
4. Screenshot and send to me if you see any

### **Verify Dev Server:**
Make sure you see this in terminal:
```
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

### **Try Different Browser:**
- Chrome Incognito
- Firefox Private Window
- Edge InPrivate

---

## 💡 **Why This Happens:**

**Browser Cache:** Your browser stored old JavaScript files and isn't loading the new code. A hard refresh forces it to download fresh files.
