# 🔧 DASHBOARD NAVIGATION FIX COMPLETE

## ✅ **NAVIGATION ISSUE RESOLVED!**

I've successfully fixed the dashboard navigation issue where users couldn't view other sections when logged into their accounts. Here's the complete solution:

---

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**

### **Issue:**
- **Seller Dashboard**: Users could only navigate within dashboard sections, couldn't access main app features
- **Admin Panel**: Admins were trapped in admin panel, couldn't browse the main site
- **Buyer Dashboard**: Customers couldn't access other parts of the website from their dashboard

### **Root Cause:**
Each dashboard component had its own internal navigation system that was completely separate from the main app navigation. When users clicked navigation items, they only changed internal state, not the main app view.
